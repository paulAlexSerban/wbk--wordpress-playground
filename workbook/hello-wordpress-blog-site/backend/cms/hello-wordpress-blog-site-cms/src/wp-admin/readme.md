# Wordpress / wp-admin
This directory contains the files necessary to run the WordPress admin interface. These files are responsible for the backend of the WordPress site. The admin interface is where users can manage the site, create and edit posts, and customize the site's appearance.

> This directory is not intended to be accessed directly by users. Instead, users should access the admin interface through the WordPress dashboard.
> If you want to update contents of this directory, uncomment the corresponding volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
