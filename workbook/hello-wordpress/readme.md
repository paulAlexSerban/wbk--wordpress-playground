# Hello Wordpress

> starter project for Wordpress local development setups

## Credentials
wp_admin: username=admin / password=admin / email=admin@hello-wordpress.com

## Troubleshooting

### Permissions issues on /uploads directory
- because of the way Docker works on MacOS, the ownership of the `/uploads` directory is not set correctly for Wordpress to write to it.
- you can fix this by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
sudo chown -R 33:33 ./hello-wordpress/backend/cms/hello-wordpress-cms/src/wp-content/uploads
```

### `auto-terms-of-service-privacy-policy` plugin not updated to the latest version of PHP
- run `docker exec hello-wordpress wp plugin list --allow-root` after you install plugin and activate it to see if it creates issues
- if it does, you can:
    - use it to create content for the legal pages you desire, copy the content and then deactivate the plugin
- if there are not issues, you can use it to create the legal pages you need and use it accordingly and delete this section from the README
